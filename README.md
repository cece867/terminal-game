We created a trivia game where each question has 4 multiple choice answers.
Player can keep playing until they get 3 questions wrong.
The game ends either when questions run out or the player reaches 3 wrong answers.
Score is tracked.

we used chatGPT to generate questions and answers to the trivia but we did not alter the questions/answers. 
we first made a data file that contained all the questions and answers
The concept was very similair to the objects lab 
we made appjs file referencing the data 
we declared all the variables
entered the conditionals 
and then played trivia for the rest of the class time
we all learned some trivia about the 7 wonders of the world ;)
